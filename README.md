# command-line-parser
A powerful annotation-driven command-line parser.

This was created as a simple and powerful way to create command-line tools, and because I couldn't find an existing library which supports multiple nested sub-commands

Usage:

1.) create or use an existing Object to hold the command-line args.
2.) Add annotations
3.) call one of the two CommandLineParser#parse methods

Please see the Unit tests and Javadoc for detailed usage.
